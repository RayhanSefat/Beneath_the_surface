# Beneath_the_surface

Beneath the Surface is an innovative tool designed to deepen people's understanding of aquatic ecosystems while fostering awareness and conservation efforts. We divide the challenging problem into three sub-problems, including: (1) Mapping species data to geographic locations, (2) Predicting species encounters, (3)Visualizing Pollutant Tour, (4) Developing personalized recommendations. The results of this project are expected to have a positive impact on the environment and on people's understanding of and appreciation for endangered species. By educating users about endangered species and providing personalized recommendations on how to avoid disturbing them, the app can help to protect endangered species populations and ensure that they continue to thrive for future generations.
